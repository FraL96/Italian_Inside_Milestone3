The Coronavirus pandemic, kept us all in our houses for more than a year.
Many people had to find a way to cope with this new reality.
Someone found a new hobby, others started to study a new language and still others decided to make plans for the future.
I, honestly, did all of them, but something that many of the people I know did, is cooking; to experiment with new recipes and organize theme dinners with their household.

While [Googleing]() new recipes I discovered how difficult it is to find an authentic recipe. Many are just Americanized versions of the genuine one with extra fats and less flavours.

A *cuisine* lover like me could not accept this so I decided to make my little part to change this.

I don't know much about other contries but I know a lot about Italy; that is how *Italian Inside* was born.

Italian Inside targets two main groups:

* Non-Italian people - To give them a place where to find authentic Italian recipes.
* Italian people - To give them the possibility to share their most precious recipes with the world.
