The Coronavirus pandemic, kept us all in our houses for more than a year.
Many people had to find a way to cope with this new reality.
Someone found a new hobby, others started to study a new language and still others decided to make plans for the future.
I, honestly, did all of them, but something that many of the people I know did, is cooking; to experiment with new recipes and organize theme dinners with their household.

While [Googleing]() new recipes I discovered how difficult it is to find an authentic recipe. Many are just Americanized versions of the genuine one with extra fats and less flavours.

A *cuisine* lover like me could not accept this so I decided to make my little part to change this.

I don't know much about other contries but I know a lot about Italy; that is how *Italian Inside* was born.

Italian Inside targets two main groups:

* Non-Italian people - To give them a place where to find authentic Italian recipes.
* Italian people - To give them the possibility to share their most precious recipes with the world.

# 1. User Experience
## Project goals

This project is being submitted as the third Milestone Project in partial fulfillment of the Full Stack Developement Program at Code Institute.
The project has the goal to demonstrate my knowledge on front-end and back-end developement. Moreover it demostrates my knowledge of the CRUD functionality - Create, Read, Update and Delete.
The technologies required to be used are HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask and Mongo DB.

The website I decided to create is targeting all the users that enjoy cooking or have interest in that field. This application provides a service to both Non-Italian users (that can browse between authentic Italian recipes) and Italian users (that can spread their knowledge about Italian cuisine and learn about recipes from regions other than the one they belong to).
Italian Inside also provides a service to me, the developer, because it advertises the wines from the company "Casale del Giglio" abroad. The developer could recive, for example, a percentage for every bottle bought by Italian Inside users.
